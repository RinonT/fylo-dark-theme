## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
 
Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## Where to find everything

The task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder.

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.
All the required assets are in the `/images` folder which are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
